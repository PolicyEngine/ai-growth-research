1/4 üìä Exploring a potential research direction at @ThePolicyEngine

Question: How do economic policies mediate AI's impact on income, consumption, and wealth distribution?

Could we model how policy interventions shape distributional outcomes under AI-driven economic change?

2/4 Possible approach: Researchers provide AI economic scenarios ‚Üí we microsimulate policy responses using PolicyEngine models ‚Üí analyze resulting distributions.

Not forecasting AI's impacts‚Äîmodeling how policies mediate them.

Could integrate with OG-USA and other general equilibrium models.

3/4 Would compare how different interventions (current policy, UBI, expanded safety nets, capital taxation) differentially shape outcomes across AI scenarios.

Building on our capabilities: 20K+ household types, AI-written reports, benefit eligibility API.

4/4 Interested in collaborating or providing feedback on this idea?

Exploring a potential research direction at PolicyEngine:

How do economic policies mediate AI's impact on income, consumption, and wealth distribution?

Recent research shows emerging concerns:
‚Ä¢ St. Louis Fed: Correlation between AI prevalence and unemployment rises
‚Ä¢ IMF: AI reduces wage inequality but substantially increases wealth inequality
‚Ä¢ Penn Wharton: AI needs 5-6x productivity to fund 11% GDP UBI

We're interested in using PolicyEngine's microsimulation platform to model how different policy interventions (taxes, transfers, UBI proposals, safety nets) would shape distributional outcomes under AI economic scenarios.

The idea: Rather than forecasting AI's impacts (not our comparative advantage), examine how policies mediate the causal chain from AI shocks to distributional outcomes‚Äîincome, consumption, wealth inequality, poverty, work incentives.

Could build on our existing capabilities:
‚úì Household-level distributional analysis (20,000+ configurations)
‚úì AI integration (first policy platform to use LLMs, April 2023)
‚úì Developer API for benefit eligibility
‚úì Enhanced CPS microdata
‚úì NBER partnership

Potential integration with general equilibrium models like OG-USA for comprehensive analysis.

Looking for feedback and potential collaborators from:
‚Ä¢ AI forecasting and economics orgs
‚Ä¢ AI safety and policy researchers
‚Ä¢ Economic modeling institutions
‚Ä¢ Forecasting platforms
‚Ä¢ Philanthropic funders interested in this space

Is this a research direction worth pursuing? Would love your thoughts.

Exploring a research idea: How do economic policies mediate AI's distributional impacts?

The concept: Rather than forecasting AI's economic effects (not PolicyEngine's comparative advantage), model how policy interventions shape the causal chain:

AI economic shocks ‚Üí policy mediation ‚Üí distributional outcomes

Would microsimulate taxes, transfers, UBI proposals, and safety nets under AI scenarios, analyzing impacts on income/consumption/wealth distribution.

Could build on PolicyEngine's existing work:
- Open-source microsimulation (transparent, collaborative)
- First policy platform to integrate LLMs (April 2023, 3 weeks after GPT-4)
- 20K+ household configurations
- NBER partnership

Could integrate with general equilibrium models (OG-USA).

Looking for feedback from AI safety, forecasting, and policy research communities. Is this worth pursuing?

At EAG NYC this weekend? I'm around Sat/Sun if you want to discuss.

**Subject:** Early-stage research idea: AI and distributional policy

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I'm exploring a potential research direction that might align with [Organization]'s work on [AI forecasting/safety/economics], and I'd value your feedback.

The idea: Use PolicyEngine's microsimulation platform to examine how economic policies mediate AI's impact on income, consumption, and wealth distribution.

Rather than forecasting AI's economic effects (not our comparative advantage), we'd model how different policy interventions (taxes, transfers, UBI proposals) shape distributional outcomes under various AI scenarios that researchers provide.

This could build on PolicyEngine's existing capabilities:
- Open-source platform enabling transparent, collaborative analysis
- 20,000+ household configurations for detailed distributional impact
- Early AI integration (first policy platform to use LLMs, April 2023)
- NBER partnership and academic collaborations

Could potentially integrate with general equilibrium models (OG-USA) and enable researchers to test their own AI assumptions against alternative policy responses.

I've put together an overview site outlining the concept:
https://policyengine.github.io/ai-growth-research/

Two questions:
1. Is this a research direction worth pursuing?
2. Would [Organization] potentially be interested in collaborating, providing feedback, or discussing support?

[If applicable: I'll be at EAG NYC this weekend (Sat/Sun) if you'd like to discuss in person.]

Best,

Thinking about a research question: How do policies mediate AI's distributional impacts?

St. Louis Fed shows AI correlating with unemployment ‚Üë
IMF finds AI ‚Üì wage inequality but ‚Üë‚Üë wealth inequality

Could PolicyEngine model how different policies (UBI, taxes, safety nets) shape these outcomes under AI scenarios?

Thoughts? https://policyengine.github.io/ai-growth-research/

Headed to EAG NYC this weekend with an early-stage research idea.

How do economic policies mediate AI's distributional impacts? (income, consumption, wealth)

Would love to chat if you're thinking about:
- AI economic scenarios
- Policy responses to automation
- Microsimulation/modeling

DM or hello@policyengine.org
```

**LinkedIn - Personal narrative:**
```
A question I've been thinking about:

AI could dramatically reshape the economy. Recent research shows concerning trends in unemployment, wage/wealth inequality, and labor displacement.

But here's what we don't know well: How would different policy responses mediate these impacts?

Would UBI shape distributional outcomes differently than expanded safety nets? How do taxes and transfers perform under high vs. low AI growth scenarios?

PolicyEngine's microsimulation platform could help answer these questions‚Äîmodeling how policies mediate the causal chain from AI shocks to distributional outcomes.

But is this the right research direction? Would it be useful to the AI safety, forecasting, and policy communities?

I've outlined the concept here: https://policyengine.github.io/ai-growth-research/

Looking for feedback. At EAG NYC this weekend if anyone wants to discuss.

## Graphics Recommendations

Consider creating quote graphics with:
- "How do economic policies mediate AI's impact on distribution?"
- "AI shocks ‚Üí Policy mediation ‚Üí Distributional outcomes"
- Stats: "St. Louis Fed: Striking correlation between AI and unemployment"
- "First policy platform to integrate LLMs (April 2023)"
- Diagram showing the causal chain
- Map showing PolicyEngine coverage (US, UK, Canada)

## Key Messaging Principles

‚úì Frame as exploration/idea, not established initiative
‚úì Emphasize seeking feedback and collaboration
‚úì Ask "Is this worth pursuing?" to invite engagement
‚úì Personal tone from Max works well for EAG audience
‚úì Focus on the mediation question, not forecasting
‚úì Highlight PolicyEngine's proven track record as foundation
‚úì Make EAG NYC availability clear and casual
