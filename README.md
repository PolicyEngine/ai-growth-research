# AI and Distributional Policy Research

A PolicyEngine research initiative examining how economic policies mediate the relationship between AI-driven economic shocks and distributional outcomes.

## Overview

This microsite outlines PolicyEngine's interest in modeling the causal chain: **AI economic shocks → policy interventions → distributional outcomes** (income, consumption, wealth). Rather than forecasting AI's economic impacts or prescribing optimal policies, we provide a framework for analyzing how different policy responses shape distributional outcomes under AI-driven economic change.

## Research Questions

- How do economic policies (taxes, transfers, UBI proposals) mediate AI's impact on income, consumption, and wealth distribution?
- How would current policies vs. alternatives (UBI, expanded safety nets, capital taxation) differentially shape distributional outcomes under AI scenarios?
- What are the inequality, poverty, and work incentive effects of different policy responses to AI economic shocks?
- How do these mediation effects vary across regions, demographics, and AI trajectories?

## Key Features

This site includes:

1. **Research Overview**: The challenge, our approach, and why this matters
2. **Relevant Research**: Summary of academic work on AI economics, labor impacts, inequality, and microsimulation
3. **Policy Scenarios**: Different policy designs to evaluate (current policy, UBI, safety net expansion, capital taxation, hybrid approaches)
4. **Technical Requirements**: What's needed to conduct this research (scenario modeling, data, computational infrastructure, validation)
5. **Potential Stakeholders**: Organizations that might be interested in supporting or collaborating on this work

## Geographic Scope

While initial work would focus on the United States using [PolicyEngine-US](https://policyengine.org/us), this research framework could be expanded to:

- **United Kingdom** ([PolicyEngine-UK](https://policyengine.org/uk)) - fully operational
- **Canada** ([PolicyEngine-Canada](https://policyengine.org/ca)) - partially developed
- Other countries where PolicyEngine models are available

Cross-country comparisons would provide valuable insights into how different tax-benefit systems respond to AI-driven economic change.

## Deployment

This site is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages automatically on pushes to `main`.

### First-time Setup

1. Go to repository Settings → Pages
2. Under "Build and deployment", select:
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will automatically deploy on the next push

### Deployment URL

Once configured, the site will be available at:
