"""Compare our scenario results to The Budget Lab's, cell by cell.

Their AI-Fiscal repository (github.com/Budget-Lab-Yale/AI-Fiscal, MIT, release
git rev 74de5986e5ff) commits the full published result grid:
`results/aggregates/ai_fiscal_publishable_2030_latest.xlsx`, with revenue by
instrument for all 18 cells. That replaces the two text-stated totals this
script previously compared against, and it corrects two errors in the earlier
version of this bridge:

  The wedge cancels its base.  Their corporate line is
  dR_CIT = X * (R_CIT_CBO / Y0_K) with X = Y0_K * g, so dR_CIT = g * R_CIT_CBO
  — the capital base drops out. All 18 committed macro_cit_delta values equal
  g x $486B to <$0.15B. The earlier bridge applied a flat 10.5% to OUR larger
  capital base, overstating the borrowed wedge (Rapid: $96B vs the correct
  $84B).

  The base is not recoverable from the wedge.  Because it cancels, "inverting
  the identity" says nothing about their Y0_K. Their methodology's remark that
  eta "falls out to roughly one in practice" implies Y0_K near $486B/0.105 ~
  $4.6T, but that rests on their prose, not on algebra this script can verify.

Alignment of cells: their share_mode R (reallocate) is our as-forecast run and
F (fixed share) is our shares-fixed counterfactual; S0/S2/S3 are our
proportional/compressive/expansive. Their microsim total = individual income
tax + payroll - refundable-credit outlays, which matches our federal IIT net of
refundable credits plus payroll.
