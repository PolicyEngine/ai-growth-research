"""AI scenarios calibrated to forecaster expectations, applied to US microdata.

The earlier experiment in `labor_capital_shift.py` sweeps an arbitrary grid
("shift 10/25/50% of labor income to capital") holding modelled market income
constant. That isolates a composition effect but has two problems: the sweep
points have no external referent, and holding output fixed rules out the
channel forecasters consider most likely -- that AI raises output *and* tilts
its composition toward capital.

This module replaces the arbitrary grid with the scenario set The Budget Lab
used in "How potential AI futures would play out in the current tax system"
(Iselin & Nunn, 2026-07-20), which in turn draws its macro inputs from the
forecaster survey in Karger et al. (2026). Matching their calibration lets our
results sit next to theirs; the differences that remain are differences in
model coverage, not in assumptions.

Three channels, following their Table 1:

1. Output.   Cumulative real GDP growth in excess of the CBO baseline path,
             g_Y = (1 + r_ai)^5 / G_CBO - 1.
2. Factor    The labor share of factor income falls from theta0_L to a
   shares.   scenario-specific theta1_L by 2030, implying
             g_K = (theta1_K (1 + g_Y) - theta0_K) / theta0_K   and
             g_L = (theta1_L (1 + g_Y) - theta0_L) / theta0_L.
3. Labor     A log-scale spread transform with parameter lambda = 1 +/- g_Y:
   inequality  ln Y1_i = mu1 + lambda (ln Y0_i - mu0),
             compressive below 1, expansive above 1.

Two calibration inputs are not printed in the report -- the CBO cumulative
baseline and the pre-shock factor shares. Both are recoverable by inverting the
published formulas against the nine derived values in their Table 1; see
`tests/test_ai_scenarios.py::test_calibration_reproduces_budget_lab_table_1`,
which pins the recovered values by reproducing all nine to within 0.005pp.

Two things we model that the Budget Lab analysis does not, and one it models
that we cannot:

  + Benefits and poverty. Their model covers federal taxes plus tax-code
    outlays. Ours carries SNAP, SSI, TANF, WIC, Medicaid/CHIP/ACA and the SPM
    poverty measure, so scenarios can be scored on the bottom of the
    distribution rather than on revenue alone.
  + State tax and benefit systems, which they do not model at all.
  - Corporate income tax. PolicyEngine-US models the household sector only.
    Their headline number includes a corporate tax wedge computed outside
    their microsimulation, so our revenue totals are not comparable to theirs
    without netting it out. See `CORPORATE_TAX_SCOPE_NOTE`.

The `realization_rate` parameter is ours, not theirs. Their capital shock
assumes the realized share of capital income is unchanged by AI, which they
flag as a limitation: a wealthier post-AI world could realize more or less of
its capital income. Because unrealized gains, retained earnings and
accruals inside retirement accounts never reach the individual tax base,
that assumption is doing real work in the revenue estimate. Setting
realization_rate < 1 routes the corresponding fraction of the incremental
capital flow outside the taxable base entirely.
